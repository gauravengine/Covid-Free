So Now I am Gonaa explain the working of the project 
The hardware module is meant to be installed in hospitals , especially covid wards

Then the patient Spo2 and heart rate readings are calculated in the microcontroller

and the data is sent to the apache server and eventually saved in the database 

The database i have used is MySql Database And the database schema is as follows :

as you can see the tables are normalised , we have separated the state table 

Now this database is connected to django website 
 
and there we display bar charts of avg spo2 and avg bpm calculated realtime 

The way we calculate svg spo2 is simple a sql query of avg() is run for each state 

which sums all the Spo2 of that state and divides it by the number of datapoints available for that state
